version 0.1.5

*  First standalone release of Rhubarb.

*  Managed classes that use the non-default db will respect assignments
   to the db class field, even if it occurs before the call to
   create_table.  This should simplify some client code.

version 0.1.4

*  0.1.3 introduced a compatibility issue with previous versions of
   Rhubarb.  These should be resolved here.

version 0.1.3 (c5c095db4d5f22d0fff6633237859cd33a319884)

*  This is a release featuring only minor enhancements to Rhubarb.  If 
   you don't use Rhubarb, there is no need to upgrade.

*  Rhubarb classes now support a delete_all method.

*  Rhubarb now supports multiple backend databases, via an extra
   parameter to Persistence::open and to the create_table class methods.
   Note that it is not currently possible to have one class backed by
   multiple databases.

version 0.1.2 (2c45fd4d693a396e9206607a6f053b1eb4696272)

*  Enhancements to SPQR/Rhubarb interoperability.  (Rhubarb row_ids are
   now used for half of the QMF object ID).

*  Enhancements to app skeleton class: now allows specifying username,
   password, hostname, and port in the constructor to SPQR::App.

version 0.1.1 (85c87b1239f730374d47e2d8baf795c8c69050f4)

*  Other minor Rhubarb fixes.

*  Rhubarb now properly handles persisting classes declared in
   different modules and supports defining custom table names.

*  spqr-gen now has preliminary support for generating classes that
   persist via rhubarb.

*  Fixes and cleanups to class- and package-name metadata.  Previously,
   the app skeleton would fail to find some manageable classes
   declared in separate Ruby modules.  In addition, the manageable
   mixin now sets sensible default names for the QMF class and package
   (when one is not provided within the class declaration).

version 0.1.0 (3a3ca52c4f086d1f20fdf5ed89dda262622c171d)

*  Note that this version breaks backwards compatibility, for reasons
   mentioned below.  Most notably, the Manageable API names have changed,
   and the old-style exposed-method declarations (with hash args) are no
   longer supported in favor of a more idiomatic style.

*  Exposed methods now use idiomatic parameter-passing style: input
   (and in/out) parameters are passed in to methods by name (in the
   order that they appear in the expose declaration), and output (and
   in/out) values are returned in a list via a standard return
   statement.  (Again, the order of output and in/out parameters is
   specified by the order that they appear in the expose declaration.)

*  Code generation now uses idiomatic parameter-passing style.  Code
   generation should still be considered "alpha"-quality.

*  Changed mixed-in method names from Manageable.

version 0.0.4  (180897a77b55400b31d364a08cb9f81c423eb59f)

*  Test suite is mainly stable (individual tests will sometimes hang
   upon creating a QMF agent).
*  This is probably the last version before I change the method call API.

version 0.0.3  (060c7b5bcaa2711b3e3ce511c9c3ecaa59bf0de8)

*  Agent-ready callback and parent-process notification (app.rb)
*  The beginnings of an SPQR test suite

version 0.0.2  (ecd94b141307c5f0f141833836ea686854cfda9c)

*  First shaky pass at automated RPM packaging (see rpmspec and
   srpm rake targets)
*  Automatic find_all methods for Rhubarb persisting classes

version 0.0.1  (0714a87f30469772fc302515e95576e329f7deb9)

*  Gem support
*  Codegen fixes

version 0.0.0  (bbbc2e9d6983f773f6d093a821a0e635714ea869)

*  Initial numbered release; corresponds roughly to the functionality
   from the "Introducing SPQR" blog posts, but with an added Rakefile.
